# Data repository of previous/current data projects
- By Kieran Arasu
Work mainly on R and Stata.

## Machine Learning
### Project 1: Breast Cancer Prognostic model
As seen here in **Insert publication**, I used survival analysis to predict which combination of factors are likely to result in breast-cancer specific death in a large dataset of over 3000 observations. Specifically, parametric Royston-Parmar models were used over
traditional semi-parametric models. Multiple imputation was also used to generate missing data.



## Machine Learning
### Project 2: 
Several different techniques were used to predict Resting Heartrate and Acute Myocardial Infarction including **Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN), bootstrapping, Cross-Validation and LASSO 
regrssion**. Best technique was assessed via accuracy or Mean Squared Error (MSE). Predictions were also made utilising information ffrom the logistic regression and KNN for technique comparison.

Tools used:
 R: Caret, FNN, Psych
