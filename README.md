# Data repository of previous/current data projects
* By Kieran Arasu
- Work mainly on R and Stata for data.
- Additionally construct 3D models and program in C# for VR environments in the Unity game engine (Additional info here).


## Machine Learning
### Project 1: Breast Cancer Prognostic model
As seen here in **Insert publication**, I used survival analysis to predict which combination of factors are likely to result in breast-cancer specific death in a large dataset of over 3000 observations. Specifically, parametric Royston-Parmar models were used over
traditional semi-parametric models. Multiple imputation was also used to generate missing data.

* Techniques used
  - Parametric survival analysis
  - Multiple imputation
  - Harrel's C-index
  - Associated R2 and discrimination
  - Multivariable fractional polynomial models (For variable selection)


## Machine Learning
### Project 2: 
Several different techniques were used to predict Resting Heartrate and Acute Myocardial Infarction including **Logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN), bootstrapping, Cross-Validation and LASSO 
regression**. Best technique was assessed via accuracy or Mean Squared Error (MSE). Predictions for resting heartrate were also made utilising information ffrom the linear regression and KNN for technique comparison.

* Techniques used
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN)
  - Imputation (Mean/Prediction)
  - Bootstrapping
  - Cross-Validation
  - LASSO regression
